		Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers.
		Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at
		least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, t
		he unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. 
		A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a 
		unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a
		section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, partic
		ularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately,
		a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In thi
		s handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.
